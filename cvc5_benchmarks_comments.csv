testEmptySort,compares two empty tables but we don't know the type of the second table
testPushFilterWithRank,Uses RANK() OVER PARTITION BY clause which uses list semantics
testSortUnionTranspose,Uses FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY clause which uses list semantics
testPushFilterWithRankExpr,Uses RANK() OVER PARTITION BY clause which uses list semantics
testEmptySortLimitZero,"Two issues FETCH NEXT 0 ROWS ONLY, and compares empty tables but we don't know the type of the second table"
